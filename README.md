* A stack is a linear data structure.
* Elements in the stack can be inserted and deleted from one side only.
* It follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.
* The order may be LIFO(LastIn First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).
* LIFO implies that the element that is inserted last,comes out first and FILO implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.
